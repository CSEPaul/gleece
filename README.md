- 🔧 **Simplify** your API development process.  
- 📜 Automatically **generate OpenAPI specs** directly from your code.  
- 🎯 Ensure your APIs are always **well-documented and consistent**.  
- ✅ **Validate input data** effortlessly to keep your APIs robust and secure.  

Gleece aims to make Go developers’ lives easier by seamlessly integrating API routes, validation, and documentation into a single cohesive workflow.
